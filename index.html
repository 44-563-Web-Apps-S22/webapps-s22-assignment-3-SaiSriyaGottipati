  <p>Given a weighted, undirected graph  with  vertices and  edges. You want to find a spanning tree of this graph which connects all vertices and has the least weight (i.e. the sum of weights of edges is minimal).<br>A spanning tree is a set of edges such that any vertex can reach any other by exactly one simple path. <br>The spanning tree with the least weight is called a minimum spanning tree.
In the left image you can see a weighted undirected graph, and in the right image you can see the corresponding minimum spanning tree.</p>
